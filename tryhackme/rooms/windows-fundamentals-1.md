modification or deletion of files within system directories can affect system
stability and security.

---

# Task 6 — User Accounts, Profiles, and Permissions

## Objective

This task examined Windows local user accounts, groups, permissions, and
built-in accounts.

## Findings

The additional local user account identified in the laboratory was:

`tryhackmebilly`

The account was a member of:

`Remote Desktop Users, Users`

The built-in account identified for guest access was:

`Guest`

The Guest account status was:

`Account is disabled`

## Security Relevance

User accounts and group memberships directly affect access to Windows
resources.

Membership in privileged or remote-access groups should be monitored because
compromised accounts can potentially be abused to access systems or resources.

Disabled accounts also help reduce unnecessary access when an account is no
longer required.

---

# Task 7 — User Account Control (UAC)

## Objective

This task introduced User Account Control and its role in controlling
administrative actions.

## Finding

UAC stands for:

`User Account Control`

## Security Relevance

UAC provides an additional privilege-control layer when applications or users
attempt to perform administrative actions.

It can help reduce unauthorized changes by requiring elevation for operations
that need administrative privileges.

---

# Task 8 — Control Panel

## Objective

This task examined Windows Control Panel and its available configuration
settings.

## Finding

When viewing the Control Panel using small icons, the requested final setting
was:

`Windows Defender Firewall`

## Security Relevance

The Windows firewall is an important endpoint security control that can help
restrict unwanted network communication.

Firewall configuration should be monitored because unauthorized changes can
weaken endpoint protection.

---

# Task 9 — Task Manager

## Objective

This task introduced Windows Task Manager and its role in viewing and
managing running processes and system activity.

## Finding

The keyboard shortcut used to open Task Manager was:

`Ctrl + Shift + Esc`

## Security Relevance

Task Manager provides useful endpoint visibility into processes, applications,
resource usage, and other system activity.

During an investigation, unusual processes or unexpected resource consumption
can provide useful leads for further analysis.

# Findings

## Finding 1 — Administrative Privileges Increase Security Risk

- **Severity:** Informational
- **Observation:** Windows distinguishes between Administrator and Standard
  User accounts.
- **Analysis:** Administrative accounts have greater authority to change system
  configuration and access protected resources.
- **Security Impact:** Excessive administrative privileges can increase the
  impact of a compromised account.

## Finding 2 — Account and Group Membership Requires Monitoring

- **Severity:** Informational
- **Observation:** The laboratory contained the `tryhackmebilly` account,
  which belonged to the `Remote Desktop Users` and `Users` groups.
- **Analysis:** Group membership determines which resources and capabilities
  an account can access.
- **Security Impact:** Unexpected membership changes can indicate unauthorized
  privilege or access changes.

## Finding 3 — Disabled Accounts Reduce Unnecessary Access

- **Severity:** Informational
- **Observation:** The built-in `Guest` account was disabled.
- **Analysis:** Disabling accounts that are not required reduces unnecessary
  authentication paths.
- **Security Impact:** Proper account lifecycle management reduces the attack
  surface of an endpoint.

## Finding 4 — UAC Provides a Privilege-Control Layer

- **Severity:** Informational
- **Observation:** Windows uses User Account Control to manage elevation of
  administrative actions.
- **Analysis:** UAC helps prevent applications and users from silently
  performing operations that require elevated privileges.
- **Security Impact:** Proper privilege separation can limit unauthorized
  system changes.

## Finding 5 — Task Manager Provides Endpoint Visibility

- **Severity:** Informational
- **Observation:** Task Manager provides visibility into running processes,
  applications, and system resource usage.
- **Analysis:** Process visibility is useful when investigating unusual
  endpoint activity.
- **Security Impact:** Unexpected processes or resource consumption can provide
  indicators for further investigation.

# MITRE ATT&CK Relevance

This room focused on Windows fundamentals rather than demonstrating a specific
adversary technique.

Therefore, no MITRE ATT&CK technique is claimed as directly observed.

The concepts covered are nevertheless relevant to defensive analysis of
account usage, privilege management, endpoint activity, and system
configuration.

Avoiding unsupported ATT&CK mappings helps keep this report technically
accurate.
