## Challenge Description

The Bandit Level 32 environment presents an intentionally restricted command
interface in which normal command input is transformed before execution.

The security-relevant behavior is that the apparent command restrictions do
not necessarily represent the complete execution environment underneath the
interface.

The investigation therefore examines:

- How command input is transformed.
- How shell parsing affects execution.
- The distinction between a command interface and the underlying shell.
- Environment and process behavior.
- How restricted execution environments can introduce unexpected security
  boundaries.
- How defenders can monitor suspicious interpreter and shell transitions.

The exercise is performed entirely within the authorized OverTheWire training
environment.

The goal is to understand the security boundary and document the investigation
methodology without publishing the challenge credential or unnecessary bypass
details.

---

## Investigation Approach

The investigation followed a controlled analysis of the restricted command
environment.

### 1. Establish the Execution Context

The authorized Bandit account was accessed through the provided SSH service.
The initial behavior of the command interface was observed before attempting
any changes to the execution context.

### 2. Observe Input Transformation

Normal command input was tested to determine how the interface processed
entered text.

The observed behavior indicated that command input was transformed to
uppercase before being interpreted.

This established an important distinction between:

- User-supplied command text.
- The transformation performed by the interface.
- The shell or interpreter ultimately responsible for execution.

### 3. Analyze Shell Parsing

The next stage examined whether shell parsing and environment behavior could
produce execution results different from those suggested by the visible
interface.

The investigation focused on understanding command interpretation rather
than relying solely on the apparent restrictions.

### 4. Examine the Underlying Execution Environment

The analysis determined that the restricted interface and the underlying shell
environment were separate security layers.

This is an important defensive concept: a wrapper that modifies or filters
input does not automatically guarantee that the underlying execution
environment is securely restricted.

### 5. Verify Execution Context

After reaching the underlying execution environment within the authorized
training lab, the resulting shell and process context were verified.

The purpose of this validation was to distinguish an actual execution-context
change from a simple change in command appearance.

### 6. Complete the Authorized Training Objective

The final stage of the challenge was completed within the OverTheWire
environment.

The resulting authentication material was treated as sensitive and was not
copied into this repository.

### Investigation Principle

The investigation followed:

**Observe → Hypothesize → Test → Validate → Document**

This approach avoids assuming that a visible command restriction represents
the complete security boundary.

## Security Concepts

This level demonstrates several security concepts relevant to command
execution and restricted environments:

- **Shell parsing:** The shell interprets command text according to its own
  parsing and execution rules.
- **Input transformation:** A wrapper or interface may modify user input
  before passing it to another interpreter.
- **Restricted shells:** Command restrictions attempt to limit the operations
  available to a user, but their security depends on how the restriction is
  implemented.
- **Command interpretation:** The visible command interface may not fully
  represent the underlying execution environment.
- **Process execution:** Shells and interpreters create processes that can be
  observed and analyzed during security investigations.
- **Execution context:** Environment variables, process state, and the active
  interpreter can affect how commands are executed.
- **Security boundaries:** A wrapper around a shell should not automatically
  be considered a complete security boundary.
- **Defense in depth:** Multiple independent controls are preferable to
  relying on a single input-filtering mechanism.
- **Least privilege:** Restricted environments should provide only the
  capabilities required for the user's legitimate task.
- **Monitoring:** Shell transitions and unexpected interpreters can provide
  valuable security telemetry.

The exercise illustrates why command restrictions should be evaluated as part
of the complete execution chain rather than by examining only the visible
interface.

## SOC / Blue Team Relevance

Restricted shells and unexpected interpreter execution can be important
signals during endpoint and server investigations.

A SOC analyst investigating suspicious shell activity should determine:

- Which account initiated the activity.
- Which shell or interpreter was originally invoked.
- Whether command input was transformed or filtered.
- Whether a different interpreter was subsequently executed.
- Which parent process launched the resulting shell.
- Which child processes were created.
- Whether the execution context changed.
- Whether the activity was expected for the account and system.
- Whether authentication or privilege boundaries were bypassed.
- Whether additional suspicious activity followed the shell transition.

### Defensive Telemetry

Potential telemetry sources include:

| Telemetry | Investigation Value |
|---|---|
| Linux authentication logs | Identify the account and authentication event |
| Process creation logs | Establish parent-child process relationships |
| Shell history | Provide contextual evidence of interactive activity |
| Audit framework logs | Record command and process execution activity |
| EDR telemetry | Detect shell and interpreter behavior |
| Environment/process metadata | Identify execution-context changes |
| SSH logs | Correlate remote access with subsequent shell activity |
| SIEM events | Correlate shell activity with authentication and endpoint events |

### Detection Opportunities

A production security monitoring program could alert on combinations such as:

**Remote Login → Restricted Shell → Unexpected Interpreter → Child Process Execution**

Additional detection logic could identify:

- Restricted-shell accounts launching unexpected interpreters.
- Shells spawned by unusual parent processes.
- Interactive shell transitions inconsistent with account behavior.
- Unexpected command interpreters on servers that normally do not require them.
- Shell execution immediately following suspicious authentication activity.
- Repeated attempts to escape restricted execution environments.
- Privileged accounts spawning unexpected child processes.
- Command execution followed by access to sensitive files or credentials.

### Investigation Questions

When an alert is generated, an analyst should ask:

1. **Who** initiated the session?
2. **Where** did the session originate?
3. **What** process or shell was launched?
4. **How** did the execution context change?
5. **Why** was the interpreter required?
6. **What** child processes were created afterward?
7. **What** files, credentials, or network resources were accessed?
8. **Was** the activity authorized?

The key defensive lesson is that shell restrictions should be monitored as part
of the broader process-execution chain. A restricted interface alone should not
be assumed to provide complete security.

## MITRE ATT&CK Relevance

The exercise has defensive relevance to command and scripting interpreter
activity on Linux systems.

### T1059.004 — Command and Scripting Interpreter: Unix Shell

The level demonstrates interaction with a Unix shell and analysis of how shell
input is interpreted within a restricted execution environment.

From a defensive perspective, this technique is relevant when monitoring for:

- Unexpected Unix shell execution.
- Shells launched by unusual parent processes.
- Shell transitions following remote authentication.
- Restricted accounts invoking unexpected interpreters.
- Suspicious command execution chains.
- Shell activity involving privileged accounts.

The mapping is used as defensive analytical context. The challenge itself is an
authorized training exercise and does not represent malicious activity.

### Defensive Detection Context

A SOC detection could correlate:

**SSH Authentication → Shell Process Creation → Unexpected Interpreter →
Child Process Activity**

Additional context such as username, source address, parent process,
command-line metadata, host role, and timing should be considered before
classifying activity as suspicious.

## Techniques and Commands

The challenge involved several practical analysis techniques:

### Restricted-Shell Analysis

Observed how the command interface transformed user input and identified the
difference between the visible interface and the underlying execution
environment.

### Shell Parsing Analysis

Examined how shell parsing rules affect command interpretation and execution.

### Environment Analysis

Considered environment variables and execution context when determining which
shell or interpreter was active.

### Process Context Analysis

Used execution-context information to distinguish the restricted interface from
the underlying shell environment.

### Controlled Shell Transition

Verified the resulting execution environment within the authorized training
lab.

Representative command categories included:

- SSH session management.
- Shell built-ins.
- Environment inspection.
- Process inspection.
- Command interpretation testing.
- Execution-context verification.

Exact challenge-specific bypass commands and authentication material are
intentionally excluded from the public documentation.

## Evidence / Screenshot Reference

Evidence for this level should demonstrate the restricted-shell behavior and
execution-context analysis without exposing the challenge credential or
unnecessary challenge-specific bypass details.

Recommended evidence includes:

1. Authorized SSH connection to the Bandit training account.
2. Initial observation of the uppercase command transformation.
3. Sanitized demonstration of restricted command behavior.
4. Evidence showing the distinction between the command interface and the
   underlying execution environment.
5. Verification of the resulting shell or execution context.
6. Sanitized confirmation that the training objective was completed.

### Screenshot Guidance

Screenshots should demonstrate the investigation process while protecting
sensitive information.

Screenshots should redact:

- Challenge credentials.
- Authentication tokens.
- Private keys.
- Sensitive environment variables.
- Unnecessary account information.
- Challenge infrastructure details that are not required for the portfolio.

A suitable screenshot sequence is:

**SSH Session → Restricted Interface Behavior → Execution-Context Analysis →
Sanitized Validation**

### Evidence Quality

Useful evidence should answer three questions:

- **What happened?**
- **How was it verified?**
- **What security-relevant conclusion was reached?**

Screenshots should therefore be supported by concise written explanations
rather than being included without context.

---

## Evidence Validation

The investigation should distinguish between observed behavior and conclusions
derived from that behavior.

A finding should be considered validated when:

- The restricted command interface behavior is reproducible within the
  authorized training environment.
- Input transformation is observed directly rather than assumed.
- The execution environment is independently verified.
- The resulting shell or process context is confirmed.
- The final training condition is successfully demonstrated.
- Sensitive authentication material is excluded from the evidence set.

The validation workflow is:

**Observation → Reproduction → Context Verification → Result Validation →
Sanitized Documentation**

Public documentation should contain only the minimum evidence necessary to
demonstrate the security concept.

Exact challenge credentials and unnecessary bypass details are intentionally
excluded.

## Credential Handling

The final challenge credential is intentionally excluded from this public
repository.

Any authentication material observed during the authorized exercise must be
treated as sensitive training data.

Sensitive values should be represented as:

`[REDACTED]`

Challenge credentials should never be copied into:

- Public README files.
- Screenshots.
- Commit messages.
- Source-code examples.
- Issue trackers.
- Public reports.
- Portfolio documentation.

If a real-world credential were exposed during a similar investigation, the
defensive response should include:

1. Treating the credential as compromised.
2. Revoking or rotating the credential.
3. Reviewing authentication and access logs.
4. Determining whether unauthorized access occurred.
5. Identifying where the credential was exposed.
6. Removing or remediating the exposed material where appropriate.
7. Documenting the incident and corrective actions.

The CTF credential is excluded because the purpose of the portfolio is to
demonstrate security methodology rather than publish authentication material.

## Learning Outcome

This level strengthened practical understanding of:

- Restricted shell behavior.
- Shell parsing and command interpretation.
- Input transformation.
- Environment and process context.
- Unix shell execution.
- Execution-boundary analysis.
- Defensive shell monitoring.
- Evidence validation.
- Secure handling of authentication material.

The most important lesson is that a visible restriction is not necessarily a
complete security boundary.

A security analyst should evaluate the entire execution chain, including the
initial interface, interpreter, parent process, child processes, environment,
identity context, and resulting activity.

From a SOC and Blue Team perspective, this reinforces the importance of
correlating authentication events with process creation, shell activity,
interpreter execution, and subsequent system behavior.

---

## Limitations

This exercise uses a controlled CTF environment and does not represent the
full complexity of enterprise Linux systems.

Real-world investigations may additionally involve:

- Multiple layers of shell wrappers.
- Privileged service accounts.
- Containerized workloads.
- Endpoint detection and response platforms.
- Centralized Linux audit telemetry.
- SSH bastion hosts.
- Identity and access-management systems.
- Privilege-management controls.
- Network monitoring.
- Large-scale SIEM correlation.
- Formal incident-response procedures.

The behavior demonstrated in the challenge should therefore be treated as a
training example rather than a complete representation of restricted-shell
security.

Detection logic should also account for legitimate administrative and
automation activity to reduce false positives.

## Ethical Use

All activity was performed within the authorized OverTheWire Bandit training
environment.

The techniques documented here are intended for cybersecurity education,
defensive analysis, and authorized security testing only.

Do not attempt to bypass shell restrictions, execute unexpected interpreters,
or access protected resources on systems without explicit authorization.

Challenge credentials and sensitive authentication material are intentionally
excluded from this public documentation.

---

## Training Outcome

The level demonstrated a practical investigation workflow for analyzing a
restricted command environment:

**Observe → Analyze Input Transformation → Examine Shell Parsing →
Verify Execution Context → Validate Result → Securely Document**

From a defensive perspective, the exercise highlights the importance of:

- Monitoring Unix shell activity.
- Correlating SSH authentication with process execution.
- Tracking parent-child process relationships.
- Detecting unexpected interpreter execution.
- Validating restricted execution boundaries.
- Applying least privilege and defense in depth.
- Protecting authentication material.
- Maintaining sanitized security evidence.

The resulting documentation records the investigation methodology, defensive
relevance, MITRE ATT&CK context, and evidence-handling practices without
publishing challenge credentials or unnecessary bypass instructions.
