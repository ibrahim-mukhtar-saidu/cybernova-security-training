## Overview

This repository documents my hands-on cybersecurity training across
authorized Capture The Flag (CTF) platforms, defensive-security exercises,
and practical security laboratories.

The training collection is designed to build transferable skills in Linux,
networking, authentication, system investigation, web security, security
monitoring, incident analysis, privilege boundaries, and defensive security.

Each training exercise is approached as a technical investigation: observing
system behavior, enumerating relevant information, forming and testing
hypotheses, analyzing evidence, identifying the underlying security concept,
and documenting the findings.

The repository is organized by training platform and security domain so that
new CTF platforms, defensive exercises, and future cybersecurity laboratories
can be added without restructuring the project.

The exercises are maintained as a structured cybersecurity learning record
with technical explanations, observed results, security implications,
defensive/SOC relevance, lessons learned, and selected supporting evidence.

2. Inspect the available files, services, permissions, or shell behavior.
3. Identify relevant technical clues.
4. Select an appropriate command or security tool.
5. Form and test a technical hypothesis.
6. Analyze the resulting evidence.
7. Document the finding and underlying security concept.
8. Consider the defensive-security relevance.

No third-party systems were intentionally targeted as part of this training.

## Documentation Structure

The repository uses a structured documentation model designed to make the
training auditable, reproducible, and easy for a technical reviewer or
recruiter to understand.

### Level Reports

Each Bandit level has a dedicated technical report under `overthewire/bandit/`.

The repository contains 34 level reports covering Bandit 00 → 33.

Each report is intended to document:

1. Objective
2. Environment
3. Challenge scenario
4. Initial observations
5. Investigation approach
6. Commands used
7. Command explanations
8. Observed results
9. Technical analysis
10. Security concept
11. Skills demonstrated
12. Defensive / SOC relevance
13. Evidence references
14. Credential-handling considerations
15. Lessons learned
16. Ethical-use scope

The goal is to document not only how a challenge was completed, but also why
a particular investigation method was selected and what broader cybersecurity
concept the exercise demonstrates.

### Cross-Level Knowledge Notes

Broader concepts encountered across multiple challenges are consolidated
under `notes/`.

The knowledge-note collection covers:

- Linux fundamentals
- Networking
- SSH
- TLS
- Privilege escalation

These notes provide cross-level explanations without unnecessarily duplicating
the individual challenge reports.

### Evidence

Evidence references are documented in the individual level reports.
Screenshots may be added selectively to demonstrate important technical
activities without exposing sensitive authentication material.

Evidence is intended to support important technical activities such as:

- Linux filesystem investigation
- File and permission analysis
- Network enumeration
- Service identification
- SSH authentication
- TLS connections
- Restricted-shell behavior
- SUID analysis
- Git investigation

Screenshots are supporting evidence and do not replace the technical
explanation contained in each level report.

### Credential Handling

Challenge passwords, private SSH keys, and other authentication material are
intentionally excluded from the public repository.

Sensitive values are represented as `[REDACTED]` where necessary.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate methodology, investigation,
technical reasoning, and security knowledge without exposing authentication
material.

### Documentation Quality Standard

Each level report should clearly distinguish between:

- Observation — what was directly observed.
- Analysis — what the observation means technically.
- Security significance — why the finding matters.
- Evidence — how the result can be verified.
- Defensive relevance — how the concept relates to security operations,
  investigation, or Blue Team work.

This structure makes the documentation easier to audit and evaluate.

### Defensive / SOC Relevance

The Bandit exercises provide foundational experience relevant to security
operations, including:

- Host and filesystem investigation
- Authentication analysis
- Network and service enumeration
- Restricted command execution analysis
- Privilege-boundary analysis
- Sensitive-data exposure awareness
- Evidence-driven investigation
- Linux command-line investigation

These exercises represent foundational laboratory training and are not
presented as equivalent to production SOC experience.

### Ethical Use

All activities documented in this repository were performed within authorized
cybersecurity training environments.

The techniques documented here should only be used against systems for which
explicit authorization has been provided.

### Learning Approach

The training follows a repeatable investigation workflow:

Observe → Enumerate → Form a hypothesis → Test → Analyze → Document evidence
→ Identify the security concept → Connect the finding to defensive security

This approach emphasizes transferable investigation skills rather than
memorization of individual challenge solutions.
