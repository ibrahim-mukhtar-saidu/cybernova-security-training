# Bandit Level 07 → 08

## Objective

Retrieve the credential required to authenticate to Bandit Level 08 by
identifying the relevant entry within a large text file.

The exercise focuses on efficient text searching rather than manually
reviewing every line of a potentially large dataset.

The primary objective is to develop the ability to translate a known search
condition into an appropriate command-line filtering operation.

## Scenario

After authenticating to the Bandit Level 07 environment, a large text file is
available in the user's home directory.

The objective is to identify the specific line containing the credential
required for the next level.

Rather than manually reading the entire file, the investigation can use
command-line text-processing tools to locate a specific search term.

This represents a basic but important security-analysis workflow:

```text
Large Dataset
      |
      v
Identify Search Condition
      |
      v
Apply Text Filter
      |
      v
Inspect Matching Entry
      |
      v
Validate Result
      |
      v
Protect Credential
```

## Investigation Approach

The investigation used a targeted text-search approach. Instead of manually reviewing the entire dataset, the known search condition was translated into a command-line filtering operation.

The workflow was:

1. Establish the current working directory.
2. Identify the relevant text file.
3. Determine the known search condition.
4. Search the dataset with `grep`.
5. Inspect the matching record.
6. Validate that the result corresponds to the challenge requirement.
7. Redact the recovered credential from public documentation.

This approach demonstrates efficient data reduction and targeted evidence discovery.

Initial Reconnaissance

The first step is to inspect the current working directory.

pwd

This establishes the current filesystem location.

The directory contents can then be examined:

ls -la

The purpose of this reconnaissance is to identify the available files before
performing content analysis.

File Identification

The relevant text file can be inspected using:

ls -l

This provides useful metadata including:

Filename
File size
Ownership
Group ownership
Permissions

The file should be treated as an investigation dataset rather than manually
opened and read from beginning to end.

## Investigation Methodology

When investigating a large text file, manually reviewing every line is
inefficient.

Instead, the analyst should identify the known search condition from the
challenge and use a text-filtering utility.

The primary tool used in this exercise is:

grep

grep searches input for lines matching a specified pattern.

Conceptually:

Large Text File
      |
      v
grep <pattern>
      |
      v
Matching Line(s)
Targeted Text Search

A targeted search can be performed with:

grep "millionth" data.txt

The search term represents the known identifier specified by the challenge.

The important point is that the investigation does not require reading the
entire file manually.

Instead, grep reduces the dataset to the relevant entry.

Command Explanation
grep
grep "millionth" data.txt

grep searches the contents of data.txt for lines containing the specified
pattern.

In this case:

Pattern:
millionth

Input:
data.txt

The command returns the line containing the requested identifier.

Why grep Is Useful

Without filtering, an analyst might have to inspect hundreds or thousands of
lines.

For example:

cat data.txt

would print the entire file.

This is generally inefficient when the investigation question is:

Which line contains a particular identifier?

Using:

grep "millionth" data.txt

provides a focused result.

This demonstrates an important command-line investigation principle:

Reduce the dataset before performing detailed analysis.

Alternative Investigation Commands

Other commands can also assist with text analysis.

less
less data.txt

Useful for interactively reviewing a large file.

head
head data.txt

Displays the beginning of a file.

tail
tail data.txt

Displays the end of a file.

wc
wc -l data.txt

Counts the number of lines in the file.

This can help an analyst understand the size of the dataset before beginning
an investigation.

Observed Result

The targeted search successfully identified the line associated with the
challenge's required identifier.

The matching line contained the credential required for Bandit Level 08.

For public documentation, the credential is represented as:

Credential: [REDACTED]

The actual authentication material is intentionally excluded from this
repository.

Technical Analysis

The exercise demonstrates basic data reduction.

Instead of processing every record equally, the analyst defines a search
condition and extracts only relevant records.

The workflow is:

Raw Dataset
    |
    v
Known Search Indicator
    |
    v
Pattern Matching
    |
    v
Relevant Record
    |
    v
Validation

This approach is common in security operations.

Large amounts of security telemetry cannot normally be reviewed manually.
Analysts use filtering, searching, and correlation techniques to identify
events requiring further investigation.

## Techniques and Commands

The investigation involved:

- Linux filesystem enumeration
- Command-line file inspection
- Targeted text searching
- Pattern matching with `grep`
- Exact-string identification
- Output filtering
- Standard input/output processing
- Search-result validation
- Candidate credential identification
- Credential protection
- Sanitized evidence collection

The investigation workflow was:

1. Establish the authorized Bandit training session.
2. Inspect the supplied challenge artifact.
3. Determine the appropriate search strategy from the challenge
   requirements.
4. Search the artifact for the relevant target string or pattern.
5. Filter the output to isolate the matching result.
6. Validate the result against the expected challenge context.
7. Confirm that the identified value represents the required next-stage
   training credential.
8. Avoid reproducing the credential in public documentation.
9. Record only the methodology and sanitized evidence.

Representative sanitized commands include:

```bash
grep -n '<sanitized-pattern>' <artifact>
```

```bash
grep '<sanitized-pattern>' <artifact> | <sanitized-filter>
```

The actual credential and unnecessary challenge-specific authentication
material are intentionally excluded from this public documentation.

The purpose of this section is to demonstrate targeted text searching,
command-line filtering, pattern recognition, result validation, and secure
handling of authentication material within an authorized cybersecurity
training environment.

## Security Concept
Pattern Matching

Pattern matching allows an analyst to identify records containing a known
string or pattern.

Examples in security operations include searching for:

IP addresses
Usernames
Hostnames
Process names
File paths
Error messages
Event identifiers
Suspicious commands
Indicators of compromise

grep provides a simple command-line implementation of this concept.

Security Concept: Data Reduction

Security environments frequently generate large volumes of data.

Examples include:

Authentication logs
Web server logs
Firewall logs
Cloud audit logs
Endpoint telemetry
DNS records
Application logs

Investigators need methods for reducing these datasets to relevant events.

The Bandit exercise provides a simple example of this principle.

## Defensive / SOC Relevance

The same concept applies directly to SOC workflows.

For example, an analyst might search authentication logs for failed logins:

grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log

Or search for a specific account:

grep "username" /var/log/auth.log

Or search for a suspicious IP address:

grep "192.0.2.10" /var/log/auth.log

These examples demonstrate how targeted filtering can accelerate host-based
investigation.

Threat Hunting Relevance

Threat hunters frequently begin with a hypothesis.

For example:

Hypothesis:
A suspicious IP address interacted with the host.

Search condition:
Specific IP address.

Dataset:
Authentication logs.

Investigation:
Search for matching records.

This is conceptually similar to the Bandit exercise.

The difference in real environments is that security datasets are usually
much larger and may require additional correlation and automation.

Investigation Efficiency

A strong security analyst should avoid unnecessary data processing.

Consider two approaches:

Inefficient
cat data.txt

Then manually inspect the output.

Targeted
grep "millionth" data.txt

The second approach directly addresses the investigation question.

This illustrates the importance of choosing tools based on the analytical
objective.

Validation

Even when a search produces a single result, the analyst should understand
why that result is relevant.

The validation process includes:

Confirming the expected file was searched.
Confirming the expected search term was used.
Confirming the returned record matches the challenge condition.
Treating the resulting credential as sensitive information.

This prevents accidental extraction of unrelated data.

## Evidence Collection

Recommended evidence for this level:

evidence/screenshots/
└── bandit-07-targeted-text-search.png

The screenshot should demonstrate:

The authenticated Bandit environment.
The relevant text file.
The grep search.
The matching record.

The actual credential should be obscured or otherwise excluded from any
public screenshot.

## Evidence Reference
Evidence	Purpose
bandit-07-targeted-text-search.png	Demonstrates targeted text searching
ls -l output	Demonstrates file reconnaissance
grep output	Demonstrates pattern matching
Redacted result	Demonstrates secure documentation

Only evidence that actually exists should be referenced in the repository.

## Credential Handling

The credential discovered during this exercise is authentication material for
the authorized training environment.

It is not included in the public repository.

Public documentation uses:

[REDACTED]

This demonstrates responsible handling of authentication information.

Even in a training environment, credentials should not be unnecessarily
published.

## Limitations

This exercise was performed in the controlled OverTheWire Bandit training
environment and therefore does not reproduce the complexity of a production
enterprise environment.

Limitations include:

- Synthetic or intentionally constructed challenge conditions.
- Limited system and network scope.
- No production authentication infrastructure.
- No enterprise SIEM, EDR, identity platform, or centralized logging.
- No real organizational incident-response process.
- Challenge objectives may simplify real-world investigative scenarios.
- Results should not be interpreted as evidence of production security
  capability by themselves.

The primary value of the exercise is the development of transferable Linux,
command-line investigation, analytical reasoning, evidence-handling, and
security-documentation skills.

## Ethical Use

All activities documented in this report were performed against the
authorized OverTheWire Bandit training environment.

The techniques should only be used against systems for which explicit
authorization has been provided.

This exercise is intended for:

Cybersecurity education
Authorized CTF training
Defensive security learning
Security research in controlled environments
Professional skills development
## MITRE ATT&CK Relevance

This exercise is a controlled text-analysis challenge rather than a direct reproduction of adversary behavior.

The strongest MITRE ATT&CK reference is:

- **T1083 — File and Directory Discovery** is conceptually relevant to the broader discovery and identification workflow demonstrated across the Bandit filesystem exercises.

For this specific level, the primary technical skill is targeted text searching and data reduction. The ATT&CK reference is therefore presented as defensive analytical context rather than a claim that the challenge directly simulates an adversary procedure.
